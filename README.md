# Flower-image-classification-using-deep-convolutional-neural-network
In this project, I trained a deep learning model for flower recognition on a GPU. I employed a convolutional neural network with residual layers. The model achieved an accuracy of 'val_loss': 0.551, 'val_acc': 0.815, 'train_loss': 0.339.
